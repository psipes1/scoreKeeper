This is simple vanilla JS scorekeeper. 
I used Bootstrap for some simple styling. 

The app defaults to a winning score of 5, but allows you to set the winning score and then tally each players score. When it reaches the winning score, it changes the winner to green and stops the game. You then press the reset button to start over.
